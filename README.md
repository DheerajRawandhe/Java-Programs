# Java-Programs
I have learned and practiced many important concepts in Java, I covered fundamental and advanced Java.

# Introduction Java :- 
Java is a powerful, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It is widely used for building web applications, mobile applications(Android), desktop software, and enterprise solutions. Code written in Java can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine.
The language supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, which help in writing modular and reusable code.

# Concepts I Have Learned :-
Here are the topics I have covered in Java :- 
-  **Operators** (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise)  
-  **Statements** (if-else, switch)  
-  **Loops** (for, while, do-while)  
-  **Strings** (String methods, manipulation)  
-  **OOP Concepts** (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
-  **Methods** (Function creation, return types, parameters)  
-  **Arrays** (Single and Multidimensional)

## How to Run Java Programs :-
1. Compile the Java file
- Terminal Command - javac filename.java
  
2. Run the Java file :-
